aws eks update-kubeconfig --name ed-eks-01 --region us-east-1

---->above cmd is only applicable either the separate linux server or windows machine has configured with aws access key and secret key
     or a iam role with eks permissions should be attached to linux server 
     after attaching role only we can use above cmd to access or upadte kubeconfig 
(i think)-->we can access cluster using worker node also but i think it is not reccommended 


in our cluster both controlplane and workernodes are in pvt subnets 
but recommened way is controlplane is in public subnets and worker nodes in pvt subnets
